# Inside A Game

In March of 2021, Bo Burnham released his Netflix 
special, "Inside", in the middle of the pandemic. 
Written, recorded, and filmed in one room by on man, 
the special revolves around the comic's sense of isolation 
and depression and his general pessimistic view of society.

After the intermission and another song about anxiety,
Bo Burnham pretends to live stream a video game called 
'Inside' by SSRI Interactive. Bo plays himself stuck in
a room, where his character's only options are to cry,
find a flashlight, and play the piano. I will recreate
this game.
